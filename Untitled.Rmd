# Peer Assessment Reproducible Research

========================================================

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
## read the activity.csv source data
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")

## remove the NA step entries from the activity data
cleaned_activity <- activity[complete.cases(activity),]
```

Question: What is the mean total number of steps taken per day?
1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
### Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
total_steps_per_day <- with(cleaned_activity, 
                            aggregate(steps, 
                                      by = list(date),
                                      sum),
                            aggregate(steps, 
                                      by = list(date), 
                                      mean)
                            )
## Set up the names for total_steps_per_day
names(total_steps_per_day) <- list("date", "total_steps")
head(total_steps_per_day)

## Plot the histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
with(total_steps_per_day, hist(total_steps, col = "blue"))

## Barplot version
barplot(total_steps_per_day$total_steps, names.arg = total_steps_per_day$date, col = "blue", xlab = "Date", ylab = "Total Number of Steps")
```

2. Calculate and report the **mean** and **median** total number of steps taken per day

```{r}

```
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
